# Architecture Overview

Txlog Server is a centralized system designed to collect, store, and visualize
transaction logs and asset data from
distributed agents.

## High-Level Architecture

The system follows a classic **Client-Server** architecture:

1. **Agents (Clients)**: Installed on servers (Linux RPM-based). They collect DNF/YUM transaction history and system
   metadata and push it to the server via HTTP/JSON.
2. **Server**: A monolithic Go application that receives data, processes it, and
stores it in a relational database.
3. **Database**: PostgreSQL serves as the single source of truth for all data.

```

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang) 1.22+
- **Web Framework**: Gin (High-performance HTTP web framework)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 13+
- **Frontend**: Server-side rendered HTML (Go Templates) with vanilla CSS/JS.
- **Scheduling**: Internal Go routines with distributed locking.

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Asset Management (Logical vs. Physical Identity)

One of the core challenges in infrastructure monitoring is distinguishing
between a _logical_ server (e.g., "web-01")
and its _physical_ instantiation.

- **Problem**: If "web-01" is re-imaged, it generates a new `/etc/machine-id`. To a naive system, this looks like a new
server, breaking history continuity.
- **Solution**: The `AssetManager` (`models/asset_manager.go`) implements a logic to link `hostname` (logical ID) with
`machine_id` (physical ID).
- When a new `machine_id` reports with an existing `hostname`, the system
automatically "deactivates" the old asset
    and creates a new active one.
- This preserves the history of "web-01" across re-installations while
maintaining an accurate audit trail of physical
    changes.

### 2. Distributed Scheduler

The server includes a built-in scheduler (`scheduler/main.go`) for background
tasks like data retention cleanup and
statistics calculation.

- **Challenge**: In a high-availability deployment (e.g., Kubernetes with 3 replicas), we cannot have all 3 instances
running the cleanup job simultaneously.
- **Solution**: **Distributed Locking via Database**.
- Before running a job, the instance attempts to acquire a named lock in the
`cron_lock` table
    (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`).
- Only the instance that successfully inserts the row executes the job.
- This allows the scheduler to be simple (no external dependencies like Redis)
yet robust for clustered deployments.

### 3. Context-Aware Database Operations

To ensure system resilience under heavy load and prevent resource exhaustion:

- All database queries and transactions are strictly context-aware (`QueryContext`, `BeginTx`).
- This allows operations to be immediately canceled if the client disconnects or if a request times out, preventing
goroutine leaks and database connection pool starvation.
- The architecture uses dependency injection for database connections, decoupling controllers and scheduled jobs from
global state and improving testability.

### 4. Authentication Strategy

The system supports a hybrid authentication model to cater to different user
needs:

- **OIDC/LDAP**: For Humans (web interface). Integrates with enterprise identity providers.
- **No-Auth Mode**: For local development or isolated networks, reducing friction during initial setup.

## Security Principles

The server implements several layers of security hardening:

1. **Cookie Security**: All session and authentication cookies are protected with `SameSite=Lax`. When the server is
   running in production mode (`GIN_MODE=release`), cookies are also marked as `Secure`.
2. **CSRF Mitigation**: State-mutating operations use `POST` requests, which are
protected by the `SameSite=Lax` cookie
   policy.
3. **No-Leak Error Handling**: API responses to clients use generic error
messages. Detailed database or internal errors
   are only visible in server-side logs.
4. **Mandatory TLS Verification**: The server always verifies TLS certificates
when connecting to external OIDC
   providers or LDAP servers. Insecure "skip verify" modes are not supported.
5. **RBAC for Destructive Actions**: Destructive operations, such as deleting an
asset or running database migrations,
   are strictly restricted to the Administrator role.
6. **Credential Masking**: Sensitive configuration values are masked in the UI
with fixed-length strings to prevent
   leaking credential lengths.

### Ingestion Pipeline

1. **Agent** sends a JSON payload to `/v1/executions`.
2. **Controller** (`controllers/api/v1/executions_controller.go`) validates the
JSON.
3. **Asset Manager** updates the asset state (create/update/replace).
4. **Transaction Manager** inserts new transactions and links them to the asset.
5. **Response**: Server returns 200 OK.

### Visualization

1. **User** requests the dashboard (`/`).
2. **Controller** queries the database for aggregated statistics (cached for
performance).
3. **Template Engine** renders the HTML with the data.
4. **Browser** displays the page (no client-side fetching for initial load).
