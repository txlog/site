# OSV Integration Explained

The Txlog server integrates tightly with the **Open Source Vulnerabilities
(OSV)** database schema distributed by Google via `api.osv.dev`, providing
real-time data on vulnerabilities affecting packages installed across your
fleet.

This document details how vulnerability records are queried, parsed, and
assigned severity scores, with particular attention to how each Linux
distribution is mapped to its correct OSV ecosystem.

The OSV database maintains **separate advisory databases** for each Linux
distribution. Each distribution publishes its own security advisories with
distinct identifiers:

| Distribution | OSV Ecosystem | Advisory Prefix | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AlmaLinux | `AlmaLinux:<major>` | ALSA | `ALSA-2024:5529` |
| Rocky Linux | `Rocky Linux:<major>` | RLSA | `RLSA-2024:5529` |
| Red Hat Enterprise Linux | `Red Hat:<CPE>` | RHSA | `RHSA-2024:5529` |

## Why This Matters

Package names alone are not enough to query OSV securely because standard Linux
packages (e.g., `curl` or `openssl`) share names across entirely different
ecosystems. If the server requested names without the correct ecosystem,
vulnerabilities from the wrong distribution would appear — for example, ALSA
(AlmaLinux) advisories showing up on Red Hat systems, or RHSA (Red Hat)
advisories on AlmaLinux systems.

## How Txlog Maps Each Distribution

Txlog queries the `assets.os` field (e.g., `"AlmaLinux 9.4"`, `"Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 9.2"`) and the `transaction_items.repo` field (e.g.,
`"baseos"`, `"appstream"`) to build the correct ecosystem identifier:

1. **AlmaLinux** → `AlmaLinux:<major>` (e.g., `AlmaLinux:9`)
2. **Rocky Linux** → `Rocky Linux:<major>` (e.g., `Rocky Linux:9`)
3. **Red Hat / CentOS / Oracle Linux** → `Red
   Hat:enterprise_linux:<major>::<channel>` (e.g., `Red
   Hat:enterprise_linux:9::baseos`)

The Red Hat ecosystem in OSV uses CPE-based identifiers that include a
repository channel suffix (`baseos`, `appstream`, or `crb`). Txlog derives the
correct channel from the `repo` column in `transaction_items`.

CentOS and Oracle Linux do not have their own ecosystems in OSV and return
`"Invalid ecosystem"` when queried directly. Since they are binary-compatible
with RHEL, Txlog maps them to the Red Hat advisories (RHSA) as the closest
match.

Google OSV's Batch API (`/v1/querybatch`) optimizes traffic but severely limits
semantic data payload by truncating fields like summary and description vectors
within arrays. To ensure precise mapping while keeping requests fast:

### 1. The Lightning Batch (The `POST` phase)

The scheduled job queries a collection of up to 500 combinations in a single
`POST` request to `api.osv.dev/v1/querybatch`. Since this request strips
metadata like `Summary`, `Details`, and the inner array block (`vuln.Affected`),
Txlog strictly uses the index order returned by Google to know which package
matched which resulting advisory list.

### 2. The Detailed Fallback (The `GET` phase)

As the engine iterates over the batches, it builds a local, in-memory **RAM
Cache**.

If an advisory (e.g., `ALSA-2022:1988` for AlmaLinux, `RHSA-2022:1988` for Red
Hat, or `RLSA-2022:1988` for Rocky Linux) returned from the batch doesn't exist
in the Go RAM Cache from past iterations, the engine initiates an isolated `GET`
to `api.osv.dev/v1/vulns/[ID]`. This fetches the full un-truncated JSON schema
containing full `Summary` strings needed for accurate severity extraction. The
data is cached locally for the rest of the scan.

Txlog uses a multi-tier approach to determine severity and CVSS scores:

### 1. CVSS Vector Parsing

When the OSV record includes a `severity[]` array with a CVSS 3.x vector string,
Txlog computes an approximate CVSS base score from the vector components (AV,
AC, PR, UI, S, C, I, A).

### 2. Distribution-Specific Severity

The `database_specific.severity` field is used as a primary source for
distributions like AlmaLinux and Rocky Linux, which include labels such as
`"Important"`, `"Critical"`, `"Moderate"`, or `"Low"`.

### 3. Text-Based Fallback

When neither structured severity data nor CVSS vectors are available, Txlog
employs keyword matching in the `summary` and `details` fields. Since
RHEL-family advisories prepend summary strings with severity keywords, these are
mapped to standard labels:

- **"CRITICAL"** → `CRITICAL` (Synthetic CVSS Score: 9.5)
- **"IMPORTANT"** → `HIGH` (Synthetic CVSS Score: 8.0)
- **"MODERATE"** → `MEDIUM` (Synthetic CVSS Score: 5.5)
- **"LOW"** → `LOW` (Synthetic CVSS Score: 3.0)

If no keyword is matched, it defaults to `UNKNOWN` (0.0).

With these extracted values stored in the database, Txlog successfully renders
Risk Mitigated charts and Severity trackers on the dashboard.
